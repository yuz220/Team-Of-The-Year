# Team-Of-The-Year
European Football

GK: M. Neuer (92) 
Back Line: Sergio Ramos(90), G. Chiellini(89), L. Bonucci(88), Marcelo(87) 
Midfield: E. Hazard(90), A.Vidal(87), G. Bale(89) 
Forward: Cristiano Ronaldo(94), L. Messi(93), Neymar(92) 

For GK (Goalkeeper), we have no position scores for it, so we use overall scores as his scores. Then, based on the squad you want to build and input the position names, we could generate a name list as the best squad by comparing their scores for each different position. However, we could see that the order of  position input will affect the result we have for some players with highest scores of multiple positions which may cause some differences between our results and the preferred position some players used to play. Just give an example in our lineup, Neymar, who used to play in the left side of the field and his score in LM(Left Midfielder) is No. 3 among the whole list, only after L. Messi and C. Ronaldo. However, we enter RW earlier than LM as his score in RW is also in the top 3 so that he fills into the RW first and for the position of LM turns to the next one, E. Hazard.
